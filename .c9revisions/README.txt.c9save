Ideas could come from various others. Scripts almost certainly will be written in PHP. Functionality may be questionable on the scripts. Some of them will be half finished or simply not working at all.\n\n------------------------------------\nLICENSE\n------------------------------------\nDo as you wish with the scripts here. All I ask is that you give proper credit when using them.\n\n------------------------------------\nSCRIPTS\n------------------------------------\n\nCODMT\n--------------\nThis script is powering the Call Of Duty Modern Tronfare server. Allot of the \"perks\" are somewhat broken or hang the php parse while theyre being executed. Allot of it could be reworked to be more efficient. Also there are barely any comments at all. Kinda my intro to arma scripting script.\n\nVoting\n--------------\nA little voting script to change game modes without using the /vote command include blah blah blah.\n\nZombies\n--------------\nInspired by Treyarch's \"Zombies Mode\" from COD, you fight onslaughts of zombies, gain points, buy weapons, and try to reach the highest round you can. Basically broken and probably wont be fixed for a while.\n\nPong\n--------------\nA little idea I had a while back. I had this awesome setup with the 0.4 polygonal zones. I quickly realized that sty had not been ported to 0.4 but not until i had worked that script out and made a map for it. If anyone would like to make a sty map with normal target zones be my guest. I'll get to it eventually though.\n\n--SoulOfSet"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":1596}]],"length":1596}
